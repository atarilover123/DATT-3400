# Experiments

This is an example of what you readme should include - images, text explanation links etc...

This week I experimented with two machine learning models.
These were the [ml5js handpose model](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/handpose) and GPT3 from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps)

Using handpose I took the keypoints of the hand and used these to spawn and attract particles. A p5.js implementation can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/Atarilover123/sketches/V2PW4biLp). I also used the position of the image points as data to control other software such as maxMSP where I used my hand to control audio playback and pitch

I also experimented bringing the GPT API into p5.js to create phrases of AI generated text.
